        <p>
          <span className="text-[#FF8762] "> Birth and Education:</span> I was
          born and raised in the northern part of Nigeria. I moved to Lagos
          State to continue my senior secondary school education. After that, I
          stayed at home for a year before heading to the university. <br />
          <br /> During my one-year stay at home, I got the opportunity to teach
          at a school; this was the beginning of my love for children and the
          need to impact them positively. I got admission into the university in
          the eastern part of Nigeria and graduated with a BSc in Microbiology.

          <span className="text-[#FF8762] "> Humanitarian Services:</span> Due
          to my love for children, I founded an NGO in 2020 that helps children
          in low-income communities have access to a good education, manage
          their health and general well-being, and feed the homeless. <br />
          <br /> So far, I and my team have been able to feed over 400 homeless
          children, give scholarships to over 20 children, serve as substitute
          teachers in public schools without teachers, clothe the less
          fortunate, counsel rape victims, and so much more with the help of
          donors and sponsors.

          <span className="text-[#FF8762] "> Product design: </span> I finally
          transitioned into product design as I have always loved creating
          beautiful designs. I attended Perxels School of Design, where I
          recieved intensive instructions about creating functional products
          that solve users' problems. I then got the opportunity to work with
          other designers, developers, and product managers to create a live
          product. I also went ahead and designed this website from scratch.

          trying out new cuisines from different cultures, and singing, even
          though I am aware I have a terrible voice.
